16.31 Project fall 2014 - Valerio Varricchio
=============

In this repository we include the MATLAB code written for the final project on the differential flatness of an N-trailer car for the course 16.31 in fall term 2014. The pdf report can be found [here][1].

While the code is mostly oragnized into classes, we included the following scripts to reproduce the examples in the report:

* [Example1_TrajectoryAssignment.m][2]
* [Example2_steer.m][3]
* [Example3_RRT_planner.m][4]

These files are commented and should work out of the box.
